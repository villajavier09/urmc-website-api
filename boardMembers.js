And let me tell you... it was quite the challenge. Although I was really struggling, I found myself captivated by the intersection of logic, innovation, and creativity that CIS incorporated. There were times where I felt really alone and extremely discouraged but I was lucky to find a safe haven in URMC. With every g-body, office hour, and workshop I attended, I felt my confidence begin to increase. With the support of my peers and advisors, I was able to successfully switch my major to Information Science, which allowed me the flexibility to be as technical and artistic as I desired.
